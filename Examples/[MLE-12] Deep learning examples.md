# [MLE-12] Deep learning examples

## Introduction

This **deep learning** exercise uses the **MNIST data** that appeared in the example MLE-09, in which we compared several ensemble classifiers for **handwritten digits**. Assuming that the evaluation of the model is based on the accuracy, we show how to improve the predictive performance of neural network models by switching from the classic MLP neural network to a **convolutional neural network**. We use standard `tensorflow.keras` procedures to develop these models.

## Questions

Q1. Split the data in a training set with 60,000 samples and a test set with 10,000 samples.

Q2. Train and test a MLP model, with a hidden layer of 32 nodes, using that split.

Q3. How does the model make predictions?

Q4. Convert the gray scale to the 0-1 range (0 = Black, 1 = White), and try again with the same MLP architecture.

Q5. Try now with a convolutional neural network. Do you get a real improvement with this *deep* model?

## Importing the data

We import the MNIST data to a Pandas data frame, as we did previously.

```
In [1]: import numpy as np, pandas as pd
   ...: path = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cinnData/MLearning/main/Data/'
   ...: df = pd.read_csv(path + 'digits.csv.zip')
```

We set the first column (image labels) as the target vector and the pixel intensities as the feature matrix. We use only NumPy arrays in this example, to simplify the syntax.

```
In [2]: y = df.iloc[:, 0].values
   ...: X = df.iloc[:, 1:].values
```

## Q1. Train-test split

We split the data as in example MLE-09, but setting `random_state=0` for reproducibility. So we can rescale the features and apply the same split to the rescaled data.

```
In [3]: from sklearn import model_selection
   ...: X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = model_selection.train_test_split(X, y, test_size=1/7, random_state=0)
```

## Q2. MLP model

As in our previous experience with neural networks, in example MLE-11, we use here the TensorFlow with the Keras API. We import the modules `models` and `layers`, that contain all the resources that we need.

```
In [4]: from tensorflow.keras import models, layers
```

Next, we specify our first **network architecture**, as a list. As in the preceding example, we use a multilayer perceptron (MLP) network with one **hidden layer** of 32 nodes, with **ReLU activation**. The **output layer** has now ten nodes, one for each digit, with **softmax activation**. These two layers are **dense layers**, meaning that every node is connected to all nodes of the preceding layer. This means 784 $\times$ 32 $\times$ 10 connections.

```
In [5]: net1 = [layers.Dense(32, activation='relu'), layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')]
```

We instantiate an object of the class `models.Sequential()`, with `layers=net1`.

```
In [6]: clf1 = models.Sequential(net1)
```

Compilation is the same as in the preceding example.

```
In [7]: clf1.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics='acc')
```

Finally, we fit the model to the training data. We don't use `verbose=0` here (this means `verbose=1`), so we are going to get a complete report of the fitting process. So, we set `epochs=20`, to keep it short. Also, with the argument `validation_data=(X_test, y_test)`, the model is evaluated on the test data at the end of every epoch.

```
In [8]: clf1.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=20, validation_data=(X_test, y_test));

This report shows that the accuracy on the test data is about 92.5% at the 10th epoch, and does not go beyond this, while it keeps improving on the training data, so it is above 94% at the 20th epoch. In example MLE-09, we did a bit better with a random forest model.

The method `.summary()` prints a summary of the network architecture, indicating the number of parameters added by every layer. In the hidden layer, every node receives 784 inputs (one for each pixel), which are combined with a linear expression involving the same number of **weights** (the slope coefficients) plus a **bias** (the intercept). So, 785 parameters are needed at every node, which makes a total of 25,120 parameters for the hidden layer. In a similar way, every output node needs 33 parameters, which adds 330 parameters to get a total of 25,450 parameters for the whole network.

## Q3. Prediction with a MLP network

For every input, the method `.predict()` returns the 10 values given by the softmaz activation at the output nodes, which are the predicted class probabilities for that input. So, for a classification model, it works as the method `.predict_proba()` in scikit-learn. For instance, for the first digit of the test set, we get:

```
In [10]: clf1.predict(X_test[:1, :])
1/1 [==============================] - 0s 74ms/step
Out[10]: 
array([[9.8956162e-01, 2.5109919e-08, 3.2807675e-03, 2.7105544e-04,
        2.8752672e-04, 2.0526997e-03, 3.6389669e-03, 3.6512902e-05,
        3.1564130e-05, 8.3928910e-04]], dtype=float32)
```

According to the model, with probability 99%, this is a zero. Indeed, the prediction is correct:

```
In [11]: y_test[0]
Out[11]: 0
```

## Q4. Rescaling the data

We rescale the pixel intensities by dividing by 255. Note that, for these data, this is equivalent to min-max normalization.

```
In [12]: X = X/255
```

Since we fixed `random_state=0` in our spli, we can replicate it for the rescaled feature matrix:

```
In [13]: X_train, X_test = model_selection.train_test_split(X, test_size=1/7, random_state=0)
```

Now, we instantiate a new model, which we train on the rescaled data. We keep `epochs=20`, even if we guess that so many epochs are not needed. The training process is not only faster, achieving accuracy 92.3% in the first epoch, but it also yields better results at the end. But, though this model performs better than the random forest models of example MLE-09, it is still weaker than the GBoost models that you have probably explored in assignment MLA-04. 

```
In [14]: clf2 = models.Sequential(net1)
    ...: clf2.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics='acc')
    ...: clf2.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=20, validation_data=(X_test, y_test));

## Q5. Convolutional neural network

We dig deeper in this last section, exploring **convolutional neural network** (CNN) models, in particular a model based on a 2D convolutional network. We continue working with the rescaled features. Instead of a (2D) 60,000 $\times$ 784 feature matrix, the inputs come as a 2D CNN model is a 4D array, in which the axes are: (a) `axis=0` with dimension 60,000, identifies the inputs, *i.e*. the pictures, (b) `axis=1` and `axis=2` both dimension 28, identify the pixel positions, and (c) `axis=2` with 1 dimension, identifies the **channel**. Since we work with gray scale, there is only one channel (with RGB pictures, we would have three channels). We reshape the arrays `X_train` and `X_-_test` into 4D arrays accordingly.

```
In [15]: Z_train, Z_test = X_train.reshape(60000, 28, 28, 1), X_test.reshape(10000, 28, 28, 1)
```

As for the MLP model, we specify the network architecture as a list of layers. The input layer is not included. In this example, we propose a standard CNN architecture, taken from the book and recommended (after much trial and error). 

In this case, every input will be 3D array, with shape `(28,28,1)`. The networks starts with a sequence of three `Conv2D` layers, with 32, 64 and 64 nodes, respectively, with two interspersed `MaxPooling` layers. After passing these layers, the input has been transformed into a set of 64 smaller 3D arrays (we will later how small). Then, this set is flattened into a 1D array, which is the input for the rest of the network, which is just a MLP network. 

```
In [16]: net2 = [layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    ...:     layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    ...:     layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'), 
    ...:     layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    ...:     layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    ...:     layers.Flatten(),
    ...:     layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    ...:     layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')]
```

The rest of the process is the same as in the MLP models. We use here `epochs=10`, to make it shorter. At the end of the first epoch, the model achieves 98% accuracy on the test data. After the 10 epochs, this has been improved to 99%, which is quite satisfactory.

```
In [17]: clf3 = models.Sequential(net2)
    ...: clf3.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics='acc')
    ...: clf3.fit(Z_train, y_train, epochs=10, validation_data=(Z_test, y_test));

As for the MLP model, we can print a summary shpowing the number of parameters involved in every layer:

* The first `Conv2D` layer has 32 nodes, with different parameters. Every node performs a special type of linear calculation, called **convolution**. The convolution extracts a single number of a 3 $\times$ 3 submatrix, using nine weights and one bias. This makes a total of 10 parameters for every node, a grand total of 32 $\times$ 10 = 320 parameters. The original 28 $\times$ 28 matrix can be covered by 26 $\times$ 26 submatrices, so the outputs of this layer have shape (26, 26, 32).

* The `MaxPooling` layer uses 2 $\times$ 2 submatrices and, instead of a convolution, it just takes the maximum value. So, no parameters are involved, and the outputs have shape (13, 13, 32). 

* The third layer has 64 nodes, with different parameters. Every node takes inputs from the 32 nodes of the preceding layer. Nine weights are needed for every input and one bias for the whole set, making a total of 32 $\times$ 9 + 1 = 289 parameters for every node, a grand total of 64 $\times$ 289 = 18,496 parameters. Now the outputs have shape (11, 11, 64).

* The next two layers can be explained in a similar way. At the fifth layer, we have added 36,928 parameters and the outputs have shape (3, 3, 64).

* The sixth layer consistes in taking 3 $\times$ 3 $\times$ 64 = 576 inputs and arranging them as a 1D arry. No parameters are involved.

* The seventh layer is a dense layer, so have we know how it works. The 64 nodes need 577 parameters each to manage the 576 inputs. So, we have 36,928 parameters more, and the output has shape (64,).

* The last layer has 10 nodes. Each node takes 64 inputs, involving 65 parameters. So we have 650 additional parameters, ad the output is a vector of 10 class probabilities.

At the end of the day, comparing this *deep* model with the previous MLP model, with only 32 hidden nodes, the number of parameters does not increase so much. The key is the **low connectivity** of the CNN model.
